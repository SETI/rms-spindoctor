"""Sum-type flag dataclasses carried on NavFeature.flags.

Each feature type has a small dataclass listing the technique-specific
boolean / scalar flags relevant to that type.  Carrying them as a typed sum
type instead of a free-form ``dict[str, Any]`` lets static type checkers see
which fields exist for each type and lets curator code copy known fields by
attribute.

class StarFlags:
    """Flags carried on a STAR feature.

    Parameters:
        saturated: True if the detected star peak hit the camera's full-well
            DN; centroiding switches from peak-Gaussian-fit to annular
            brightness-weighted moment.
        smear_length_px: Expected smear length in pixels at this image's
            spacecraft attitude rate.  Must be ``>= 0``.
        in_body_silhouette: True if the predicted star position falls inside
            a predicted body silhouette in extfov.
        in_saturation_or_cosmic_mask: True if the predicted star position
            falls inside a saturation or cosmic-ray mask pixel.
        predicted_snr: Magnitude-margin-derived effective SNR for the
            catalog star (``SNR_REF * 2.512 ** (mag_limit - vmag)``), not a
            DN-based photometric SNR.  Monotone in catalog brightness, so
            ``StarUniqueMatchNav`` can still rank stars by it when picking
            the unique-bright pair.  ``0.0`` for fixtures or features whose
            model did not populate it.  Must be ``>= 0``.
        vmag: Catalog V-band magnitude of the star, or ``None`` when the
            catalog entry has no magnitude.  Used by ``StarUniqueMatchNav``
            to compute the magnitude margin to the next-brightest star.
        photometry_corrected: True when this star's catalog magnitude was
            replaced by a trusted YBSC or Tycho-2 reference value because the
            source catalog's bright-end aperture photometry was saturated, so
            its ``vmag`` (and therefore ``predicted_snr``) is trustworthy.
        photometry_saturated: True when the catalog magnitude is a saturated
            bright-end reading with no YBSC or Tycho-2 reference to correct
            it, so ``vmag`` is an untrusted lower bound on brightness (the
            star is at least this bright, likely brighter).  The detectability
            model keeps such a star rather than rejecting it on its too-faint
            reading, and a wide-offset brightness anchor is trusted only when
            this is False.

        predicted_diameter_px: Predicted disc diameter in pixels (longer
            axis of the predicted ellipse silhouette).  Must be ``>= 0``.
        phase_angle_deg: Phase angle (Sun -> body -> observer) at the
            body's center, in degrees.  Recorded for diagnostic
            inspection; the BLOB confidence formula consumes
            ``phase_irregularity_factor`` instead, since raw phase alone
            understates the centroid uncertainty for an irregular body.
            Must be in ``[0, 180]``.
        phase_irregularity_factor: Dimensionless coupling of phase angle
            and shape irregularity, computed by the body NavModel as
            ``(ellipsoid_rms_residual_km / body_radius_km) *
            (1 + 2 * sin^2(phase / 2))``.  Captures the centroid-bias
            risk that the lit-weighted predicted centroid cannot fully
            correct for.  The fractional ``residual / radius`` term is
            ~ 0.005 for regular moons and ~ 0.05-0.10 for irregular
            satellites; the phase factor goes from 1 at full-phase
            (rotational orientation always unknown) to 3 at full
            crescent (most of the body unlit, hiding most of the
            irregularity).  Must be ``>= 0``.
        sub_solar_dir_vu: Unit ``(v, u)`` image-plane direction from the
            body's geometric center toward the bright limb (the
            projection of the body-to-Sun vector).  ``(0.0, 0.0)`` when

            whose lit centroid coincides with its geometric center).
            ``BodyBlobNav`` orients its phase-aware coarse-acquisition
            template along this direction so a high-phase crescent
            displaced beyond its predicted bounding box is still found; a
            filled-disc template cannot match a thin crescent.  Both
            components must lie in ``[-1, 1]``.
        ephemeris_sigma_px: The body's ephemeris position uncertainty, in pixels
            at the body: the SPK residual of its shape entry divided by the image
            scale at its limb.  ``BodyBlobNav`` adds it to each blob's centroid
            variance on both axes.  ``0.0`` when unknown.  Must be finite and
